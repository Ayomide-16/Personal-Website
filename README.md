## 💻 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher)
-   npm or pnpm

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Ayomide-16/Personal-Website.git
    cd Personal-Website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Start development server**

    ```bash

    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The app will run at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar).

## 📝 Configuration

Most content can be updated directly in `src/constants.ts` without modifying component logic.

1.  Open `src/constants.ts`.
2.  Update the `PERSONAL_INFO`, `PROJECTS`, `SKILLS`, and other constants with your own data.
3.  Save the file, and the changes will reflect immediately.

## 🚢 Deployment

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1.  Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
2.  Push your changes to GitHub.
3.  Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings (Action or Branch).
